Mandatory code signing in installation packages is a crucial factor in ensuring security. If the installation package is modified, Windows App Installer will raise an error due to the signature being compromised, preventing user installation. We can see this practice everywhere in today&#39;s mobile operating systems. On the Windows platform, due to strict identity verification procedure, the prices of code signing certificates have remained high.</p><p>Before version 1.4.11, Snap Hutao used a self-signed certificate. In this mode, users had to manually install DGP-Studio&#39;s certificate to allow the installation of applications signed by DGP-Studio&#39;s certificate on their computers. Starting from version 1.4.11, Snap Hutao was listed on the Microsoft Store, and Microsoft provided a GUID <code>35C8E923-85DF-49A7-9172-B39DC6312C52</code> for Hutao&#39;s developer account. This GUID was used as the publisher name of Snap Hutao, providing a special free signature (only used for Microsoft Store apps). If you are accustomed to updating the Snap Hutao with MSIX packages, you should always see this GUID in the publisher column.</p><p>Listing on the Microsoft Store eliminated the need for Snap Hutao users to manually install the signing certificate and supported the distribution of Snap Hutao installation packages, reducing a significant amount of costs for the development team. However, the cumbersome approval process often disrupted the development plans of the Snap Hutao. Therefore, over the past six months, the development team has been seeking a solution. SignPath is a company based in Vienna, Austria, that provides code signing integration software. In early December 2023, the Snap Hutao development team successfully obtained sponsorship from the SignPath Foundation, allowing us to use their code signing certificates for Snap Hutao free of charge. This greatly assisted the Snap Hutao project by not only allowing the Snap Hutao to get rid of constraints of the Microsoft Store but also avoiding the high annual certificate fees.</p><p><strong>Due to the migration to a new certificate causing package name conflicts, Snap Hutao provides the following detailed explanation to assist all users in updating to version 1.9.0 and future versions.</strong></p><h2 id="upgrade-to-version-1-9-0" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#upgrade-to-version-1-9-0" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Upgrade to Version 1.9.0</h2><h3 id="version-release" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#version-release" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Version Release</h3><p>Snap Hutao version 1.9.0 is scheduled to be released on the weekend before Christmas 2023.

We anticipate that we will not continue to release updates in the Microsoft Store in the future unless we have a better way to handle coexistence issues between different signature packages. Although Snap Hutao will no longer go through Microsoft&#39;s certification, under SignPath&#39;s restrictions, Snap Hutao will only be able to compile and build release packages directly from the GitHub code repository. This means that the code in the user&#39;s installation package is 100% sourced from our GitHub code repository, and anyone has the authority to review and participate in development.</p><p>Starting from version 1.9.0 of the client, we will integrate a software update module to adapt to the new release method. We will minimize the operations required for user updates as much as possible. As this feature is brand new, we are still in the deployment process. Please continue to pay attention to our in-app announcements and community for information!</p>',15);function g(f,m){const o=s("RouterLink");return r(),l("div",null,[h,t("blockquote",null,[t("p",null,[e("1.9.0 version has been released, please download from "),d(o,{to:"/en/quick-start.html"},{default:c(()=>[e("Quick Start")]),_:1}),e(" page.")])]),p])}const w=i(u,[["render",g],["__file","version-1-9-0-breaking-changes.html.vue"]]);export{w as default};
