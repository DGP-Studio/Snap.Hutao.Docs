As the project has developed, we have built a series of supporting services as middleware for Snap Hutao.</p><p>Currently, the development team is making some of these practical services available to the open-source community in the form of open interfaces, for use by developers who share our vision. We have written detailed usage documentation for these interfaces, provide maintenance support, and answer frequently asked questions. Whether you are an experienced developer or a beginner, we hope that these interfaces can assist you in your application development.</p><h2 id="snap-hutao-api-snap-hutao-cloud-developer-license" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#snap-hutao-api-snap-hutao-cloud-developer-license"><span>Snap Hutao API &amp; Snap Hutao Cloud Developer License</span></a></h2><p>The Snap Hutao API is an interface service that exposes the Snap Hutao Spiral Abyss Database, designed to provide data access support for open-source software developers.</p><p>By applying for the Snap Hutao API Developer License, developers will not only gain access to the database but also receive full access to the Snap Hutao Cloud features within Snap Hutao as a bonus.</p><p>Developers can submit applications through the <a href="https://homa.snapgenshin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snap Hutao API Open Platform</a> to obtain a developer license.</p><h2 id="uigf-interchangeable-data-record" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#uigf-interchangeable-data-record"><span>UIGF Interchangeable Data Record</span></a></h2><p>The Snap Hutao project is committed to promoting the free flow of user data among different open-source tools, and to this end, it has drafted the initial version of the <a href="https://uigf.org/en/standards/UIGF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uniformed Interchangeable Gacha Log Format (UIGF)</a>.</p><p>This standard has now been recognized and adopted by an increasing number of developers and is continuously being improved.</p><p>Many developers have gathered at the <a href="https://github.com/UIGF-org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UIGF-Org</a> open-source organization.
