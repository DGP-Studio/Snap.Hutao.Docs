<blockquote>
<p>Hutao Passport is the internal name of Snap Hutao Account, they are the same thing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Snap Hutao account is an account system created by the DGP-Studio team to serve Snap Hutao, which will be used to provide cloud-based services in the future, including wish records synchronization.</p>
<p>If you have Hutao Cloud privileges, you will have the following permissions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>Prediction</code> function in the Wish Record page</li>
<li>Cloud synchronization function of wish records</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>After your Snap Hutao account cloud synchronization permission expires, you will not be able to upload, download, and delete data, but your data will not be deleted. You can re-operate your cloud backup data after restoring privilege.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since cloud synchronization is a function that consumes Hutao server resources, this function has a time limit. Currently, Snap Hutao provides the following methods to enable the cloud synchronization function:</p>
<ol>
<li>For users who reward Hutao on Aifadian, we will automatically add usage time to the Hutao account that matches the Aifadian email account as a thank you from the Hutao Toolbox development team to the reward users.</li>
<li>For all registered users, after successfully uploading the Spiral Abyss challenge record to the Hutao database for the first time in each schedule, they will get 3 days of privilege time.
<ul>
<li>You can use Hutao Cloud for free for a long time through this method.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Users who contribute to the Snap Hutao open source community (including but not limited to code development, program UI design, localization translation) can directly contact the development team to obtain a developer license.
<ul>
<li>We are currently designing a complete and automated developer license issuance process, which will be launched with the improvement of the Hutao account system.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This document is applicable to users upgrading from Snap Hutao versions <strong>1.4.11 to 1.8.4</strong> to version 1.9.0 and higher.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Snap Hutao is a Windows sandbox application in MSIX format, providing the convenience of installation and the security of AppX applications. Mandatory code signing in installation packages is a crucial factor in ensuring security. If the installation package is modified, Windows App Installer will raise an error due to the signature being compromised, preventing user installation. We can see this practice everywhere in today's mobile operating systems. On the Windows platform, due to strict identity verification procedure, the prices of code signing certificates have remained high.</p>
<p>Before version 1.4.11, Snap Hutao used a self-signed certificate. In this mode, users had to manually install DGP-Studio's certificate to allow the installation of applications signed by DGP-Studio's certificate on their computers. Starting from version 1.4.11, Snap Hutao was listed on the Microsoft Store, and Microsoft provided a GUID <code>35C8E923-85DF-49A7-9172-B39DC6312C52</code> for Hutao's developer account. This GUID was used as the publisher name of Snap Hutao, providing a special free signature (only used for Microsoft Store apps). If you are accustomed to updating the Snap Hutao with MSIX packages, you should always see this GUID in the publisher column.</p>
<p>Listing on the Microsoft Store eliminated the need for Snap Hutao users to manually install the signing certificate and supported the distribution of Snap Hutao installation packages, reducing a significant amount of costs for the development team. However, the cumbersome approval process often disrupted the development plans of the Snap Hutao. Therefore, over the past six months, the development team has been seeking a solution. SignPath is a company based in Vienna, Austria, that provides code signing integration software. In early December 2023, the Snap Hutao development team successfully obtained sponsorship from the SignPath Foundation, allowing us to use their code signing certificates for Snap Hutao free of charge. This greatly assisted the Snap Hutao project by not only allowing the Snap Hutao to get rid of constraints of the Microsoft Store but also avoiding the high annual certificate fees.</p>
<p><strong>Due to the migration to a new certificate causing package name conflicts, Snap Hutao provides the following detailed explanation to assist all users in updating to version 1.9.0 and future versions.</strong></p>
<h2>Upgrade to Version 1.9.0</h2>
<h3>Version Release</h3>
<p>Snap Hutao version 1.9.0 is scheduled to be released on the weekend before Christmas 2023. We will publish the download links for the installation package through GitHub, Jihu GitLab, this official website, and the community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.9.0 version has been released, please download from <a href="/en/quick-start.html" target="_blank">Quick Start</a> page.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Uninstall Old Versions</h3>
<p>Directly installing this package will cause problems depending on your system version due to package name and signature conflicts.</p>

<p>When launching the Snap Hutao for the first time, the client will automatically enter an initialization setup guide to assist users in configuring the client correctly.</p>
<p>Currently, Snap Hutao will guide users through the process of setting the language, confirming user agreements, checking necessary environmental configurations, and downloading static resources.</p>
<details class="hint-container details"><summary>Language Setting</summary>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i1/1797064093/O1CN01wBgRV01g6dyC2bc62_!!1797064093.png_.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>In the language settings section, you can choose from the interface languages currently supported by Snap Hutao. If you change the language, the Snap Hutao will automatically restart.</p>
<p>Snap Hutao uses Simplified Chinese as the base language and actively maintains English text.
Traditional Chinese, Korean, and Japanese texts are translated by community contributors.
If you're interested in contributing translations, you can lend your support at <a href="https://translate.hut.ao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://translate.hut.ao</a>.</p>

<p>In the user agreement documents confirmation section, you will need to confirm several documents provided by Snap Hutao.
These documents can help you understand the nature of the Snap Hutao project and will be beneficial for your future usage.</p>
</details>
<details class="hint-container details"><summary>Environment Checking</summary>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/1797064093/O1CN01LYYIB41g6dyDFB6I9_!!1797064093.png_.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>In the environment checking section, Snap Hutao will utilize two small tests to assist users in determining whether the system environment, which will enhance user experience, has been installed: the Segoe Fluent Icons font and the WebView2 Runtime.</p>
<p>You can assess whether these two environment packages are installed based on the prompts. If they are not installed, you can click the corresponding link buttons to download and install the required content.</p>
<p>The image above is the expected outcome in this step.</p>
</details>
<details class="hint-container details"><summary>Assets Download</summary>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/1797064093/O1CN01XlICiR1g6dyC7Qpy6_!!1797064093.png_.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>In this step, Snap Hutao will automatically download the required static image resources.
Once the download is complete, Snap Hutao will close the initialization setup interface and automatically load the main program.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Snap Hutao project has received wide supports from the open-source community and users since its
inception on GitHub on April 18, 2022. As the project has evolved, we have created a series of supporting services
as middleware for Snap Hutao.</p>
<p>Now, the development team is making some of these practical services available to the open-source community in the
form of open interfaces, for use by developers who share our vision. We will be writing usage documentation for these
interfaces, maintaining the services, and providing answers to frequently asked questions. Whether you are an
experienced developer or a beginner, we hope that these interfaces will assist you in creating applications.</p>
<h2>Hutao API &amp; Hutao Cloud Open-source Developer's License</h2>
<p>Hutao API is an interface service that exposes the Hutao Abyssal Database.
Open-source software authors can use the Hutao API to retrieve data from the Hutao database or upload data.</p>
<p>Developers who gain access to the Hutao API also receive full privileges to the Hutao Cloud feature
within the Snap Hutao as a benefit.</p>
<p>Developers can apply for access by submitting their information through the Hutao API Open Platform
at <a href="https://homa.snapgenshin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">homa.snapgenshin.com</a></p>
<h2>Enka API with China Acceleration</h2>
<p><a href="https://enka.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enka Network</a> is an excellent Genshin Impact tool that provides detailed data on characters in
the user's current character showcase. However, due to restricted access to certain network services in China,
the stability of Enka Network's functionality in the region is compromised.</p>
<p>To ensure a smooth user experience for Snap Hutao users in China, the development team has utilized Enka Network's data
for the development of the <a href="/en/features/character-data.html" target="_blank">My Characters</a> feature and established a proxy server.</p>
<p>Developers can ask for access in Snap Hutao development group chat or discord group from administrator.</p>
<h2>UIGF Interchangeable Game Data Format</h2>
<p>Snap Hutao aims to enable the free flow of user data among various open-source tools with different features.
To facilitate this, Snap Hutao has established the initial version of the <a href="https://uigf.org/en/standards/UIGF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uniformed Interchangeable GachaLog Format
Standard (UIGF)</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, this standard has gained more recognition among developers, leading to the promotion of additional
standards. Many developers have now gathered under the <a href="https://github.com/UIGF-org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UIGF organization</a>. Our goal is to
maintain this organization, allowing developers to connect with more users, receive feedback, make technical advancements,
and create outstanding open-source Genshin Impact tools.</p>

<h2>1.9.0</h2>
<div class="hint-container important">
<p class="hint-container-title">Breaking Changes</p>
<p>Snap Hutao recently obtained sponsorship from the SignPath Foundation for code signing certificates. Starting from version 1.9.0, we will use a brand-new certificate to sign Snap Hutao installation packages.</p>
<p>Programs with the new signature will be incompatible with old versions. Users updating from versions 1.8.4 and older to 1.9.0 and newer versions need to uninstall the old version first and then perform a fresh installation of the new version of the client. Due to the design of Snap Hutao's data directory, users will not lose any important data.</p>
<p>You can read the article <a href="/en/blog/version-1-9-0-breaking-changes.html" target="_blank">Explanation of Breaking Changes in Version 1.9.0</a> for a deeper understanding of how the signature changes in this version update affect the Snap Hutao project.</p>

</ul>
<h3>How to Create Desktop Shortcut (With Admin Privilege)</h3>
<p>Click <code>Create Desktop Shortcut</code> in the settings page.</p>
<h3>How to run Snap Hutao when Windows starts</h3>
<div class="hint-container warning">
<p class="hint-container-title">Warning</p>
<p><strong>This is a workaround solution.</strong> Approaches may fail in practice due to various problems.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Create a bat file, content refers to <a href="https://github.com/DGP-Studio/Snap.Hutao/issues/184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Issue</a>, it allows bat to run Snap Hutao with Administrator privilege</li>
<li>Create a Scheduled Task, run the bat when Windows startup, or drag it to Windows start folder</li>
</ul>
<h3>Unable to Run Snap Hutao as Administrator</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This issue only occurs in Windows 10 older than 22H2 version</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When user's OS version older than <code>Windows Build 19045</code> (aka Windows 10 22H2), Snap Hutao is unable to start when
running as Administrator
<ul>
<li>This issue comes from Windows kernel, and it's hard to locate, so we suggest you to update your OS to the latest version</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use Snap Hutao with Network Proxy</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Snap Hutao has a well-designed cloud network structure, you should be able to get good network service wherever you are located</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loopback network are disabled for all Windows Appx container application (including Snap Hutao), so some modern network proxy software will cause container applications to lose Internet access, and lead to application errors.</p>
<p>If you need network proxy to use Snap Hutao, you can try the following solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Config in Snap Hutao
<ul>
<li>Open <code>Feedback Center</code> and click <code>Config Loopback Exemption</code> and follow the instructions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Config in network proxy software
<ol>
<li>Enable <code>TUN Mode</code> in your network proxy software if it supports</li>
<li>Contact your network proxy software provider for help, ask solution of Windows Appx container application proxy configuration</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

The following feature tutorials are introduced in-program order.</p>
<h2>About Snap Hutao</h2>
<p>This part has the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The icon of Snap Hutao：You can find the original image of the icon at the <a href="/" target="_blank">home page</a>
<ul>
<li>The artist is <a href="https://space.bilibili.com/274422134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">画画的芦苇 (BiliBili)</a><details class="hint-container details"><summary>Drawing Process</summary>
</details>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/DGP-Studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DGP-Studio</a> is authorized by owner to use it for Snap Hutao Project</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Snap Hutao Account</h2>
<p>You can sign up and sign in your Snap Hutao Account in settings page.</p>
<p>For more detail about this feature, please refer to <a href="/en/features/hutao-passport.html" target="_blank">Snap Hutao Account</a> document.</p>
<h2>Administrator Mode Tools</h2>
<p>On the right side of the settings page, the development team has set up an administrator mode tool for users who need it. Under this module, we provide two functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Restart the program immediately as an administrator</li>
<li>Create a PowerShell shortcut on the desktop to start Hutao as administrator</li>
</ol>
<h2>CAPTCHA</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This feature is most likely to be useful for CN server (MiYouShe) users</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If daily check-in and realtime notes functions are essential for you, then the <code>-1034</code> error from miHoYo's anti-bot verification will definitely be a major interference. This is because miHoYo uses Geetest to intercept requests directly executed by non-humans, and some requests from Snap Hutao will be judged by Geetest as robot behavior and cause request failure. If you use a third-party service to verify the Geetest captcha, you can pass the random data generated by Geetest to the verification service provider through this setting.</p>
<p>After successfully configuring this setting, Snap Hutao will directly call this verification service to pass the Geetest verification when performing real-time note automatic refresh and miHoYo community check-in, avoiding the generation of -1034 error by miHoYo.</p>
<h2>Appearance</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Language</p>

<li>Snap Hutao will following system language setting by default</li>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Why does setting up automatic refresh of real-time notes prompt "Failed to modify Scheduled Task"</h3>
<p>The automatic refresh of real-time notes relies on task scheduling. In order to avoid possible permission issues, Snap Hutao will force scheduled tasks to be set in non-administrator mode.</p>
<p>If you turned on automatic refresh in the old version, you can solve the problem by manually deleting the old task schedule in Task Scheduler. The name of the scheduled task is <code>SnapHutaoDailyNoteRefreshTask</code>.</p>
<p>If you did not turn on automatic refresh in the old version, then this problem is caused by the Windows user account you are currently using having insufficient permissions. If your current user account is an administrator account, you can only solve this problem by reinstalling the system.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>MiHoYo BBS Account often Lose Login Status</h3>
<p>Snap Hutao use saved MiHoYo BBS cookies to maintain login status. If you <strong>log out</strong> your account in your browser or
other device, cookie will become invalid, and Snap Hutao will also be forced to log out, account will be automatically
removed.</p>
<p>This problem may also be caused by network error, you should check this first; If it's not caused by network issue,
you can use <code>Refresh Cookie</code> in the account panel; You can also remove your account manually and add it back again.</p>
<p>Since October 2022, MiYouShe (Chinese BBS) rapidly increased bot detection and may set users' account as under-risk status,
this may cause Snap Hutao failed to check validation of the cookie</p>

      <description>Snap Hutao utilizes various methods to obtain users&amp;apos; login information and combines it with the Genshin Impact API to retrieve gacha records.</description>
      <category>FAQ</category>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 01:02:49 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Snap Hutao's Gacha system underwent an overhaul compared to Snap Genshin, experiencing a complete architectural redesign.</p>
<p>This article will explain the Genshin's wish logging mechanism and the technical principles behind the Gacha export feature in the Snap Hutao.</p>
<h2>Obtaining Wishes</h2>
<p>Acquiring wish records requires querying miHoYo's API.</p>
<p>Regarding this API, there are a few key points to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Through miHoYo's server API, you can only access wish records from the past 6 months.
<ul>
<li>This is also the source of wish records in the original Genshin client.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The API has rate limits; too many requests too quickly can lead to subsequent failures, making it impossible to retrieve data.</li>
</ul>
<p>To request this API, we need four crucial parameters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, several methods can obtain these parameters:
<ul>
<li>Traversing Unity's log files to find URLs for wish records opened by the user</li>
<li>Proxying local traffic to filter wish record URLs</li>
<li>Looking through the CefBrowser's browser cache to find wish record URLs</li>
<li>For Cookies containing Stoken, calling the genAuthKey API to obtain parameters</li>
<li>Advanced users manually inputting relevant URLs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon requesting the API, you receive fragmented wish records. Concatenating them provides a complete wish record list.</p>
<h2>Wish Storage</h2>
<p>After obtaining the complete wish record list, you can easily serialize it into a local database. When necessary, deserialization from the database presents it to the user.</p>
<p>Subsequent requests to the server only need to compare new data requests against the database's existing data.</p>
<p>This way, users can permanently store their account's complete wish records.</p>
<h2>UIGF Format</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Unified Interchangeable GachaLog Format</p>
</blockquote>
<p>UIGF is a unified wish record data exchange standard, advocated, launched, and <strong>persistently maintained</strong> by us in collaboration with other wish record applications.</p>
<p>Standardized data formats enable users to transfer wish records between different tools for Genshin, each leveraging its distinctive functionalities.</p>
<h3>Importing Wishes</h3>
<p>When utilizing the UIGF data format, you can import data previously stored in other applications.</p>
<p>Hutao, during import handling, compares the earliest index (ID) existing in local storage and only imports older data.</p>
<p>(This is because newer data of higher precision is always available from miHoYo's servers.)</p>
<h3>Exporting Wishes</h3>
<p>Snap Hutao exports wish records in the UIGF data format in Json file, allowing users to share their wish records with others or import them into other applications.</p>

<p>Snap Hutao is an open-source Genshin Impact toolkit under MIT license, designed for modern Windows platform to improve
the gaming experience for desktop players. By combining existing official resources with new features designed by the
development team, it provides a complete and useful set of tools without the need to rely on mobile devices. Snap Hutao
does not take any destructive modification to the game client to ensure the security of the toolkit.</p>
<p>Snap Hutao is using MSIX format package. MSIX is a native Windows application package format that streamlines the installation, update, and removal process of software. One of its standout features is its use of sandbox technology. This means that applications packaged in MSIX run in isolated environments, preventing them from making system-wide changes. This isolation enhances security as it limits the application's access to system resources and user data. Furthermore, when an MSIX-packaged application is uninstalled, it leaves no residual files or registry entries, maintaining the cleanliness and stability of the system. This is a significant improvement over traditional installation methods that often leave behind "digital debris" when applications are removed. The combination of these features makes MSIX a powerful tool for both developers and end-users, providing a seamless, secure, and clean software management experience.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Gacha is one of the core gameplay in Genshin Impact. Whether it's for commemorative and show-off purposes,
or for serious planning for a gacha strategy, it's very important to perform statical analysis on historical gacha record.
However, Genshin Impact only provides players with six months of gacha records, which is not user-friendly <s>(although they
still keep tracking how many Timmie's pigeons you've killed for the whole year)</s></p>
<p>Therefore, we need to use the gacha records from these six months to retrieve the data and transfer the record to our
local device. This is the purpose of wish history export feature in Snap Hutao.</p>
<p>Regarding the technical principles of exporting Genshin Impact gacha records,
you can refer to our article on <a href="/en/advanced/Gacha-system-and-export-principal.html" target="_blank">Gacha System and Export Principles</a></p>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/1797064093/O1CN01X360be1g6e0wf4UNv_!!1797064093.png_.webp" alt="wish export" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><strong>As shown in the above figure, through the wish history feature in Snap Hutao, you can clearly obtain the following information:
total number of wishes, current pity count, quantity and percentage of obtained items with different rarity, number of
times a 5-star rarity item was not obtained and the current pity status.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additionally, user with Hutao Cloud can view prediction data calculated by Hutao Cloud server</strong></p>
<div class="hint-container note">
<p class="hint-container-title">Delay in Gacha Data Export</p>
<p>Snap Hutao retrieves gacha records from the MiHoYo servers, which means that recently made wishes may not be immediately
available. When you see the latest batch of gacha records in the game's own history, then you can then obtain the corresponding
statistics from Snap Hutao.</p>
</div>
<h2>Fetch Wish History</h2>
<h3>SToken Refresh </h3>
<div class="hint-container info">
<p class="hint-container-title">Hint</p>
<ul>
<li>This method requires user to sign in to MiHoYo BBS account in Snap Hutao, refer to
<a href="/en/features/mhy-account-switch.html" target="_blank">MiHoYo BBS Account Switch</a> to get to know how to sign in to your MiHoYo BBS account</li>
<li><strong>SToken Cookie refresh method does not support oversea server (HoYoLAB)</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the account you want to refresh wish history has been signed in to Snap Hutao</li>
<li>Switch to <code>Wish History</code> feature page in Snap Hutao</li>
<li>Click on <code>Refresh</code> button and select <code>SToken Refresh</code></li>
<li>Wait for refresh task to complete</li>
</ul>
<h3>Refresh with Web Cache </h3>
<ul>
<li>Switch to <code>Wish History</code> feature page in Snap Hutao</li>
<li>Start the game, go to in-game wish history page</li>
<li>Go back to Snap Hutao, clock on <code>Refresh</code> button and select <code>Refresh with Web Cache</code></li>
<li>Wait for refresh task to complete</li>
</ul>
<div class="hint-container tip">
<p class="hint-container-title">Tips</p>
<p>If errors keep occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to settings page in Snap Hutao</li>
<li>Execute operation <code>Delete game embeeded browser web cache</code></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Input URL Manually </h3>
<ul>
<li>If you get your personal wish history URL, you can select <code>Manual Input</code> and submit your wish history URL</li>
<li>Be aware that the URL is time-sensitive</li>
</ul>
<h3>Full Refresh</h3>
<p>By default, Snap Hutao will stop importing gacha records once it matches a Wish ID that already exists locally.
However, if you wish to obtain all the historical records from the Genshin Impact servers
(even if they are already present in your local wish history), you can check the "Full Refresh" option.</p>
<p>Not selecting <code>Full Refresh</code> will <strong>not</strong> cause you to lose your wishing data,
