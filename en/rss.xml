      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1> Explanation of Breaking Changes in Version 1.9.0</h1>
<p>This document is applicable to users upgrading from Snap Hutao versions <strong>1.4.11 to 1.8.4</strong> to version 1.9.0 and higher.</p>
<h2> Introduction</h2>
<p>Snap Hutao is a Windows sandbox application in MSIX format, providing the convenience of installation and the security of AppX applications. Mandatory code signing in installation packages is a crucial factor in ensuring security. If the installation package is modified, Windows App Installer will raise an error due to the signature being compromised, preventing user installation. We can see this practice everywhere in today's mobile operating systems. On the Windows platform, due to strict identity verification procedure, the prices of code signing certificates have remained high.</p>
<p>Before version 1.4.11, Snap Hutao used a self-signed certificate. In this mode, users had to manually install DGP-Studio's certificate to allow the installation of applications signed by DGP-Studio's certificate on their computers. Starting from version 1.4.11, Snap Hutao was listed on the Microsoft Store, and Microsoft provided a GUID <code>35C8E923-85DF-49A7-9172-B39DC6312C52</code> for Hutao's developer account. This GUID was used as the publisher name of Snap Hutao, providing a special free signature (only used for Microsoft Store apps). If you are accustomed to updating the Snap Hutao with MSIX packages, you should always see this GUID in the publisher column.</p>
<p>Listing on the Microsoft Store eliminated the need for Snap Hutao users to manually install the signing certificate and supported the distribution of Snap Hutao installation packages, reducing a significant amount of costs for the development team. However, the cumbersome approval process often disrupted the development plans of the Snap Hutao. Therefore, over the past six months, the development team has been seeking a solution. SignPath is a company based in Vienna, Austria, that provides code signing integration software. In early December 2023, the Snap Hutao development team successfully obtained sponsorship from the SignPath Foundation, allowing us to use their code signing certificates for Snap Hutao free of charge. This greatly assisted the Snap Hutao project by not only allowing the Snap Hutao to get rid of constraints of the Microsoft Store but also avoiding the high annual certificate fees.</p>
<p><strong>Due to the migration to a new certificate causing package name conflicts, Snap Hutao provides the following detailed explanation to assist all users in updating to version 1.9.0 and future versions.</strong></p>
<h2> Upgrade to Version 1.9.0</h2>
<h3> Version Release</h3>
<p>Snap Hutao version 1.9.0 is scheduled to be released on the weekend before Christmas 2023. We will publish the download links for the installation package through GitHub, Jihu GitLab, this official website, and the community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.9.0 version has been released, please download from <a href="/en/quick-start.html" target="blank">Quick Start</a> page.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3> Uninstall Old Versions</h3>
<p>Directly installing this package will cause problems depending on your system version due to package name and signature conflicts.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center">System Version</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Expected Issues</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">Windows 10</td>
<td style="text-align:center">Unable to install; signature and package name conflicts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">Windows 11</td>
<td style="text-align:center">Installation successful;<br>Coexistence with old versions of Snap Hutao with the same name causes program runtime errors</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Due to the above issue, you need to uninstall the old version of Snap Hutao first and then install the 1.9.0 version package.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How to uninstall Snap Hutao</strong>: Find Snap Hutao in the Start menu, right-click, and select uninstall; another quick method is to find it in Windows App Settings and choose uninstall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Your important data (including logged-in miHoYo accounts, wish records, achievement data, Spiral Abyss records, My Character cache data, and development plans) will not be lost, they are still stored in your local Hutao data directory on your computer.</strong> However, the following data will be reset:</p>
<ol>
<li>Snap Hutao runtime count</li>
<li>Data folder path <strong>(if you previously modified the data directory, remember your data directory path)</strong></li>
<li>Hutao account (Hutao Passport) login status</li>
<li>Closed Hutao announcement flags</li>
<li>Development plan preset level information</li>
<li>Dashboard card status on the homepage</li>
<li>Auto-click function status</li>
</ol>
<h3> Install the New Version</h3>
<p><img src="/images/202312/1-8-5-installer.png" alt="1.8.5 Version Installer" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Run the 1.9.0 version installer you have already downloaded. In the installation interface, you should see the publisher as <code>SignPath Foundation</code>. Click install to install the all-new version of Snap Hutao!</p>
<p><strong>If you modified the data directory location in the old version, you need to select the data directory path again in the settings after starting to restore the data. If you have never set a data directory, your data will be loaded directly without additional setup.</strong></p>
<h2> Future Plans</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft Store, future releases, software security...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Microsoft Store, the application publisher name must be a GUID assigned by Microsoft, not a "custom" name like <code>SignPath Foundation</code>. We anticipate that we will not continue to release updates in the Microsoft Store in the future unless we have a better way to handle coexistence issues between different signature packages. Although Snap Hutao will no longer go through Microsoft's certification, under SignPath's restrictions, Snap Hutao will only be able to compile and build release packages directly from the GitHub code repository. This means that the code in the user's installation package is 100% sourced from our GitHub code repository, and anyone has the authority to review and participate in development.</p>
<p>Starting from version 1.9.0 of the client, we will integrate a software update module to adapt to the new release method. We will minimize the operations required for user updates as much as possible. As this feature is brand new, we are still in the deployment process. Please continue to pay attention to our in-app announcements and community for information!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1> Initial Setup Guide</h1>
<p>When launching the Snap Hutao for the first time, the client will automatically enter an initialization setup guide to assist users in configuring the client correctly.</p>
<p>Currently, Snap Hutao will guide users through the process of setting the language, confirming user agreements, checking necessary environmental configurations, and downloading static resources.</p>
<details class="hint-container details"><summary>Language Setting</summary>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i1/1797064093/O1CN01wBgRV01g6dyC2bc62_!!1797064093.png_.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>In the language settings section, you can choose from the interface languages currently supported by Snap Hutao. If you change the language, the Snap Hutao will automatically restart.</p>
<p>Snap Hutao uses Simplified Chinese as the base language and actively maintains English text.
Traditional Chinese, Korean, and Japanese texts are translated by community contributors.
If you're interested in contributing translations, you can lend your support at <a href="https://translate.hut.ao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://translate.hut.ao</a>.</p>
</details>
<details class="hint-container details"><summary>User Agreement Confirmation</summary>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/1797064093/O1CN01Zv1EGr1g6dy8E1fpj_!!1797064093.png_.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>In the user agreement documents confirmation section, you will need to confirm several documents provided by Snap Hutao.
These documents can help you understand the nature of the Snap Hutao project and will be beneficial for your future usage.</p>
</details>
<details class="hint-container details"><summary>Environment Checking</summary>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/1797064093/O1CN01LYYIB41g6dyDFB6I9_!!1797064093.png_.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>In the environment checking section, Snap Hutao will utilize two small tests to assist users in determining whether the system environment, which will enhance user experience, has been installed: the Segoe Fluent Icons font and the WebView2 Runtime.</p>
<p>You can assess whether these two environment packages are installed based on the prompts. If they are not installed, you can click the corresponding link buttons to download and install the required content.</p>
<p>The image above is the expected outcome in this step.</p>
</details>
<details class="hint-container details"><summary>Assets Download</summary>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/1797064093/O1CN01XlICiR1g6dyC7Qpy6_!!1797064093.png_.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>In this step, Snap Hutao will automatically download the required static image resources.
Once the download is complete, Snap Hutao will close the initialization setup interface and automatically load the main program.</p>
</details>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1> Hutao Open Platform</h1>
<p>The Snap Hutao project has received wide supports from the open-source community and users since its
inception on GitHub on April 18, 2022. As the project has evolved, we have created a series of supporting services
as middleware for Snap Hutao.</p>
<p>Now, the development team is making some of these practical services available to the open-source community in the
form of open interfaces, for use by developers who share our vision. We will be writing usage documentation for these
interfaces, maintaining the services, and providing answers to frequently asked questions. Whether you are an
experienced developer or a beginner, we hope that these interfaces will assist you in creating applications.</p>
<h2> Hutao API &amp; Hutao Cloud Open-source Developer's License</h2>
<p>Hutao API is an interface service that exposes the Hutao Abyssal Database.
Open-source software authors can use the Hutao API to retrieve data from the Hutao database or upload data.</p>
<p>Developers who gain access to the Hutao API also receive full privileges to the Hutao Cloud feature
within the Snap Hutao as a benefit.</p>
<p>Developers can apply for access by submitting their information through the Hutao API Open Platform
at <a href="https://homa.snapgenshin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">homa.snapgenshin.com</a></p>
<h2> Enka API with China Acceleration</h2>
<p><a href="https://enka.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enka Network</a> is an excellent Genshin Impact tool that provides detailed data on characters in
the user's current character showcase. However, due to restricted access to certain network services in China,
the stability of Enka Network's functionality in the region is compromised.</p>
<p>To ensure a smooth user experience for Snap Hutao users in China, the development team has utilized Enka Network's data
for the development of the <a href="/en/features/character-data.html" target="blank">My Characters</a> feature and established a proxy server.</p>
<p>Developers can ask for access in Snap Hutao development group chat or discord group from administrator.</p>
<h2> UIGF Interchangeable Game Data Format</h2>
<p>Snap Hutao aims to enable the free flow of user data among various open-source tools with different features.
To facilitate this, Snap Hutao has established the initial version of the <a href="https://uigf.org/en/standards/UIGF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uniformed Interchangeable GachaLog Format
Standard (UIGF)</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, this standard has gained more recognition among developers, leading to the promotion of additional
standards. Many developers have now gathered under the <a href="https://github.com/UIGF-org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UIGF organization</a>. Our goal is to
maintain this organization, allowing developers to connect with more users, receive feedback, make technical advancements,
and create outstanding open-source Genshin Impact tools.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1> Gacha System and Export Principle</h1>
<p>Snap Hutao's Gacha system underwent an overhaul compared to Snap Genshin, experiencing a complete architectural redesign.</p>
<p>This article will explain the Genshin's wish logging mechanism and the technical principles behind the Gacha export feature in the Hutao Toolbox.</p>
<h2> Obtaining Wishes</h2>
<p>Acquiring wish records requires querying miHoYo's API.</p>
<p>Regarding this API, there are a few key points to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Through miHoYo's server API, you can only access wish records from the past 6 months.
<ul>
<li>This is also the source of wish records in the original Genshin client.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The API has rate limits; too many requests too quickly can lead to subsequent failures, making it impossible to retrieve data.</li>
</ul>
<p>To request this API, we need four crucial parameters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, several methods can obtain these parameters:
<ul>
<li>Traversing Unity's log files to find URLs for wish records opened by the user</li>
<li>Proxying local traffic to filter wish record URLs</li>
<li>Looking through the CefBrowser's browser cache to find wish record URLs</li>
<li>For Cookies containing Stoken, calling the genAuthKey API to obtain parameters</li>
<li>Advanced users manually inputting relevant URLs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon requesting the API, you receive fragmented wish records. Concatenating them provides a complete wish record list.</p>
<h2> Wish Storage</h2>
<p>After obtaining the complete wish record list, you can easily serialize it into a local database. When necessary, deserialization from the database presents it to the user.</p>
<p>Subsequent requests to the server only need to compare new data requests against the database's existing data.</p>
<p>This way, users can permanently store their account's complete wish records.</p>
<h2> UIGF Format</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Unified Interchangeable GachaLog Format</p>
</blockquote>
<p>UIGF is a unified wish record data exchange standard, advocated, launched, and <strong>persistently maintained</strong> by us in collaboration with other wish record applications.</p>
<p>Standardized data formats enable users to transfer wish records between different tools for Genshin, each leveraging its distinctive functionalities.</p>
<h3> Importing Wishes</h3>
<p>When utilizing the UIGF data format, you can import data previously stored in other applications.</p>
<p>Hutao, during import handling, compares the earliest index (ID) existing in local storage and only imports older data.</p>
<p>(This is because newer data of higher precision is always available from miHoYo's servers.)</p>
<h3> Exporting Wishes</h3>
<p><s>Not yet implemented; under design</s> Already implemented</p>

<ol>
<li>Enable <code>TUN Mode</code> in your network proxy software</li>

<h2> 1.9.0</h2>
<div class="hint-container important">
<p class="hint-container-title">Breaking Changes</p>
<p>Snap Hutao recently obtained sponsorship from the SignPath Foundation for code signing certificates. Starting from version 1.9.0, we will use a brand-new certificate to sign Snap Hutao installation packages.</p>
<p>Programs with the new signature will be incompatible with old versions. Users updating from versions 1.8.4 and older to 1.9.0 and newer versions need to uninstall the old version first and then perform a fresh installation of the new version of the client. Due to the design of Snap Hutao's data directory, users will not lose any important data.</p>
<p>You can read the article <a href="/en/blog/version-1-9-0-breaking-changes.html" target="blank">Explanation of Breaking Changes in Version 1.9.0</a> for a deeper understanding of how the signature changes in this version update affect the Snap Hutao project.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1> Wish History</h1>
<p>Gacha is one of the core gameplay in Genshin Impact. Whether it's for commemorative and show-off purposes,
or for serious planning for a gacha strategy, it's very important to perform statical analysis on historical gacha record.
However, Genshin Impact only provides players with six months of gacha records, which is not user-friendly <s>(although they
still keep tracking how many Timmie's pigeons you've killed for the whole year)</s></p>
<p>Therefore, we need to use the gacha records from these six months to retrieve the data and transfer the record to our
local device. This is the purpose of wish history export feature in Snap Hutao.</p>
<p>Regarding the technical principles of exporting Genshin Impact gacha records,
you can refer to our article on <a href="/en/advanced/Gacha-system-and-export-principal.html" target="blank">Gacha System and Export Principles</a></p>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i1/1797064093/O1CN01AYR3I41g6dyGBmAw5_!!1797064093.png_.webp" alt="wish export" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><strong>As shown in the above figure, through the wish history feature in Snap Hutao, you can clearly obtain the following information:
total number of wishes, current pity count, quantity and percentage of obtained items with different rarity, number of
times a 5-star rarity item was not obtained and the current pity status.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additionally, user with Hutao Cloud can view prediction data calculated by Hutao Cloud server</strong></p>
<div class="hint-container note">
<p class="hint-container-title">Delay in Gacha Data Export</p>
<p>Snap Hutao retrieves gacha records from the MiHoYo servers, which means that recently made wishes may not be immediately
available. When you see the latest batch of gacha records in the game's own history, then you can then obtain the corresponding
statistics from Snap Hutao.</p>
</div>
<h2> Fetch Wish History</h2>
<h3> Refresh with SToken Cookie </h3>
<div class="hint-container info">
<p class="hint-container-title">Hint</p>
<ul>
<li>This method requires user to sign in to MiHoYo BBS account in Snap Hutao, refer to
<a href="/en/features/mhy-account-switch.html" target="blank">MiHoYo BBS Account Switch</a> to get to know how to login to your MiHoYo BBS account</li>
<li><strong>SToken Cookie refresh method does not support global server (HoYoLAB)</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the account you want to refresh wish history has been signed in to Snap Hutao</li>
<li>Switch to <code>Wish History</code> feature page in Snap Hutao</li>
<li>Click on <code>Refresh</code> button and select <code>SToken Refresh</code></li>
<li>Wait for refresh task to complete</li>
</ul>

<li>Start the game, go to in-game wish history page</li>
<li>Go back to Snap Hutao, clock on <code>Refresh</code> button and select <code>Refresh with Web Cache</code></li>
<li>Wait for refresh task to complete</li>
</ul>
<div class="hint-container tip">

<p>If errors keep occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to settings page in Snap Hutao</li>
<li>Execute operation <code>Delete game embeeded browser web cache</code></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3> Refresh with Manually Input URL </h3>
<ul>
<li>If you get your personal wish history URL, you can select <code>Manual Input</code> and submit your wish history URL</li>
<li>Be aware that the URL is time-sensitive</li>
</ul>
<h3> Explanation on Full Refresh Option</h3>
<p>By default, Snap Hutao will stop importing gacha records once it matches a Wish ID that already exists locally.
However, if you wish to obtain all the historical records from the Genshin Impact servers
(even if they are already present in your local wish history), you can check the "Full Refresh" option.</p>
<p>Not selecting <code>Full Refresh</code> will <strong>not</strong> cause you to lose your wishing data,
and selecting <code>Full Refresh</code> will <strong>not</strong> cause your local records to mistakenly record the same wishing data twice.</p>
<h3> Import Wish History Data from Other Applications </h3>
<p>Snap Hutao supports importing wish history data file that in <code>UIGF data format</code><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref1"></a></sup></p><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref1">
<p>If you need to import such type of data, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start Snap Hutao, switch to <code>Wish History</code> feature page</li>
<li>Select <code>Import</code></li>
<li>Select your UIGF Json data file</li>
<li>Check the imported file information and confirm to import</li>
</ul>
</a><h2><a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-ref1"></a> Export Wish History Data </h2>
<p>Snap Hutao support exporting wish history data to a Json file written in UIGF data format</p>
<p>If you need to export the wish history data, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start Snap Hutao, switch to <code>Wish History</code> feature page</li>
<li>Switch to the archive you want to export, and select <code>Export</code>
<ul>
<li>In the pop-up window, confirm your export path</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Confirm and export data</li>
</ul>
<h2> Wish History Cloud Sync </h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Wish history cloud sync is designed on Snap Hutao Account.
You need to <a href="hutao-settings#snap-hutao-account">register an account in the settings</a> to use this feature</p>
</blockquote>

transfer data between devices.</p>

<h3> <img src="/images/202312/MSEdge.webp" width="20" height="20"> WebView2 Runtime</h3>
<p>WebView2 Runtime is provided by Microsoft, which enables a built-in browser at a low resource cost inside the program.
As an optional component, WebView2 is not a mandatory component, but it will make some Snap Hutao's features easier.</p>

pop-up panel, click the login button right corresponding to your account.</p>
<p>If you are using a China server account, you need login within <code>MiYouShe</code> category; If you are using an oversea account
