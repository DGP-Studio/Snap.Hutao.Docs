      <description>Introduction to Loopback Network and Solutions for Network Proxy Failures</description>
      <category>FAQ</category>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 04:59:21 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>What is Loopback Network</h2>
<p>"Appx container applications" are a type of application promoted by Microsoft, with many advantages. To ensure they are efficient, secure, stable and user-friendly, Microsoft has taken a series of restrictive measures for these applications. One of these measures is the "Loopback Network".</p>
<p>Windows by default <strong>disables Loopback Network for all Windows Appx container applications (including Snap Hutao)</strong>. This design aims to limit the network access range of applications, allowing them to only access the resources they need to operate.</p>
<h3>Understanding Loopback Network</h3>
<p>You can think of the "Loopback Network" as a "box" that an application is placed into. This "box" isolates the application's network environment from the local computer environment, allowing the application to interact with the external network only through a small hole.</p>
<p>When the external network environment changes (such as enabling a network proxy or a game accelerator), the small hole may become blocked, causing the application inside the box to be unable to communicate with the external network.</p>
<h2>Potential Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Snap Hutao cannot access the network after a proxy is enabled.</li>
<li>Certain network-related functions (such as Wish record export, Real-time Notes refresh, etc.) fail.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<h3>1. Configure within Snap Hutao (Recommended)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open Snap Hutao.</li>
<li>Click "Feedback Center" in the left menu.</li>
<li>In the right sidebar, find and click "Unblock Loopback Restriction".</li>
<li>Click the "Confirm" button in the pop-up window.</li>
</ol>
<p>This operation will remove the Loopback restriction, allowing Snap Hutao to use proxy networks normally.</p>
<h3>2. Configure in the Network Proxy Software</h3>
<ol>
<li>Enable <strong>TUN Mode</strong> (if your network proxy software provides this option).</li>
<li>Contact your network proxy service provider and ask for technical support on resolving network proxy issues for Windows Appx container applications to get targeted solutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>By using the methods described above, you can effectively resolve network proxy failures caused by Loopback restrictions and enable Snap Hutao to run normally in various network environments.</p>

<p><img src="/images/202501/hutao_account.webp" alt="account_page" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>The Snap Hutao Passport is an account system created by the DGP-Studio team for Snap Hutao, used to provide cloud-based services, including the Snap Hutao Cloud Wish Record service. You can navigate to the Snap Hutao Passport page by clicking the Snap Hutao Passport button in the left menu bar of the Snap Hutao client, view and manage your Snap Hutao Passport.</p>
<h2>Cloud Service Description</h2>
<p>Cloud-related features consume a significant amount of server resources, therefore, they have time limits. Currently, Snap Hutao provides the following ways to enable cloud synchronization:</p>
<ol>
<li>For users who support Snap Hutao on AfDian, we will automatically add usage time to the Snap Hutao Passport that matches the AfDian email account as a token of appreciation from the Snap Hutao development team.
<ul>
<li>After payment, you should receive an email receipt. You can click the "Refresh" button on the right side of the Snap Hutao Passport to refresh the renewal status. Due to data synchronization delays, if the refresh fails, please wait about 5 minutes and try again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For all registered users, after each Genshin Impact account successfully uploads the Spiral Abyss challenge record to the Snap Hutao database for the <strong>first time in each period</strong>, you will get 3 days of Wish synchronization feature usage time.
<ul>
<li>You can use the Snap Hutao Cloud Wish Record service for free in the long term through this method.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Users who contribute to the Snap Hutao open-source community (including but not limited to code development, program design, and localization translation) can directly contact the development team to obtain a developer license or redemption code.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Snap Hutao Cloud Wish Record Service</h2>
<div class="hint-container warning">
<p class="hint-container-title">Warning</p>
<p>When your Snap Hutao Passport cloud synchronization permission expires, you will not be able to upload, download, or delete data, but your data will not be deleted. You can re-operate your cloud backup data after restoring your permissions.</p>
</div>
<p>If you have Snap Hutao Cloud permission, you will have the following privileges:</p>
<ol>
<li>The "Prediction" feature on the Wish Record page</li>
<li>Cloud synchronization feature of Wish records</li>
</ol>
<div class="hint-container info">
<p class="hint-container-title">Snap Hutao Passport and Genshin Impact Account Relationship</p>
<p>Note: The relationship between Genshin Impact account data and Snap Hutao Passport is "<strong>many-to-one</strong>". That is, one Snap Hutao Passport can be associated with the Wish data of multiple Genshin Impact accounts, but one Genshin Impact account can only be associated with one Snap Hutao Passport.</p>
<p>If you are unable to upload wish records due to reasons such as purchasing a second-hand account, please negotiate with the previous account holder for data security reasons. Snap Hutao will not and cannot resolve related wish conflicts.</p>
</div>
<h2>Snap Hutao Cloud CDN Service</h2>
<p>This feature allows users to download Snap Hutao updates through servers deployed in mainland China. Usually, this method can significantly improve the download speed for users in mainland China.</p>
<h2>Change Email/Change Password/Log Out Account/Refresh Account Status</h2>
<p>Click the corresponding button according to your needs. Please note that after changing your password or email, you will be automatically logged into the modified account.</p>
<p>If you have supported Snap Hutao on websites like AfDian but your account status is not updated, you can click the "Refresh" button on the right side of the account to manually refresh the status. If the status is still not displayed correctly after waiting for 5 minutes and manually refreshing, please contact the developers.</p>

<p>This document is applicable to users upgrading from Snap Hutao versions <strong>1.4.11 to 1.8.4</strong> to version 1.9.0 and higher.</p>
<div class="hint-container important">
<p class="hint-container-title">This document has been archived</p>
<p>This page has been archived. To install Snap Hutao, please visit <a href="/en/quick-start.html" target="_blank">Quick Start</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Snap Hutao is a Windows sandbox application in MSIX format, providing the convenience of installation and the security of AppX applications. Mandatory code signing in installation packages is a crucial factor in ensuring security. If the installation package is modified, Windows App Installer will raise an error due to the signature being compromised, preventing user installation. We can see this practice everywhere in today's mobile operating systems. On the Windows platform, due to strict identity verification procedure, the prices of code signing certificates have remained high.</p>
<p>Before version 1.4.11, Snap Hutao used a self-signed certificate. In this mode, users had to manually install DGP-Studio's certificate to allow the installation of applications signed by DGP-Studio's certificate on their computers. Starting from version 1.4.11, Snap Hutao was listed on the Microsoft Store, and Microsoft provided a GUID <code>35C8E923-85DF-49A7-9172-B39DC6312C52</code> for Hutao's developer account. This GUID was used as the publisher name of Snap Hutao, providing a special free signature (only used for Microsoft Store apps). If you are accustomed to updating the Snap Hutao with MSIX packages, you should always see this GUID in the publisher column.</p>
<p>Listing on the Microsoft Store eliminated the need for Snap Hutao users to manually install the signing certificate and supported the distribution of Snap Hutao installation packages, reducing a significant amount of costs for the development team. However, the cumbersome approval process often disrupted the development plans of the Snap Hutao. Therefore, over the past six months, the development team has been seeking a solution. SignPath is a company based in Vienna, Austria, that provides code signing integration software. In early December 2023, the Snap Hutao development team successfully obtained sponsorship from the SignPath Foundation, allowing us to use their code signing certificates for Snap Hutao free of charge. This greatly assisted the Snap Hutao project by not only allowing the Snap Hutao to get rid of constraints of the Microsoft Store but also avoiding the high annual certificate fees.</p>
<p><strong>Due to the migration to a new certificate causing package name conflicts, Snap Hutao provides the following detailed explanation to assist all users in updating to version 1.9.0 and future versions.</strong></p>
<h2>Upgrade to Version 1.9.0</h2>
<h3>Version Release</h3>
<p>Snap Hutao version 1.9.0 is scheduled to be released on the weekend before Christmas 2023. We will publish the download links for the installation package through GitHub, Jihu GitLab, this official website, and the community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.9.0 version has been released, please download from <a href="/en/quick-start.html" target="_blank">Quick Start</a> page.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Uninstall Old Versions</h3>
<p>Directly installing this package will cause problems depending on your system version due to package name and signature conflicts.</p>

<p>When launching Snap Hutao for the first time, the program will automatically enter the initialization guide to help users correctly configure the various functions of the tool.
The guide process includes setting the language, confirming important user agreements, checking the necessary system environment, and downloading static resources.</p>
<h2>Language Settings</h2>
<details class="hint-container details"><summary>Details</summary>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/1797064093/O1CN016IMEtP1g6dyEFo5uK_!!1797064093.png_.webp" alt="language-selection" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>In the language settings section, you can choose the interface language supported by Snap Hutao. If you change the language, the program will automatically restart to apply the changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplified Chinese is the base language of Snap Hutao, and the development team also maintains the English translation.</li>
<li>Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean translations are contributed by the Crowdin community.</li>
<li>The remaining languages are translated by the Google Gemini AI model.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in contributing to the translation, you can visit <a href="https://translate.hut.ao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://translate.hut.ao</a> to provide assistance.</p>
</details>
<h2>User Agreement</h2>

<p>In the user agreement section, you need to read and agree to the relevant agreements and terms of service provided by Snap Hutao. These documents are designed to help you understand the nature of the Snap Hutao project and the rules for using the tool.</p>
<p>After confirming and accepting the agreement, you can continue to complete the initialization process.</p>
</details>
<h2>Environment Check</h2>
<details class="hint-container details"><summary>Details</summary>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/1797064093/O1CN01T3lLLI1g6dyDspUsf_!!1797064093.png_.webp" alt="environment-check" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Snap Hutao will automatically detect the following key runtime environments and prompt the user whether they need to be installed or updated:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Segoe Fluent Icons font</strong>: Provides a better interface icon display effect.<br>
Download address: <a href="https://aka.ms/SegoeFluentIcons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Segoe Fluent Icons</a></li>
<li><strong>WebView2 Runtime</strong>: A modern browser component that supports the core functions of the tool.<br>
Download address: <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2124701" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebView2 Runtime</a></li>
</ol>
<p>If a missing environment is detected, you can click the corresponding link to download and complete the installation.<br>
The above image shows the expected display effect of this step under a complete environment.</p>
</details>
<h2>Resource Download</h2>
<details class="hint-container details"><summary>Details</summary>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i1/1797064093/O1CN01QILPRh1g6dyHTUpV9_!!1797064093.png_.webp" alt="resource-download" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>In the resource download section, Snap Hutao will automatically obtain the required static image resources. After the resource download is complete, the initialization process will automatically close, and the main interface of the tool will be loaded.</p>
<p>If the resource download fails, Snap Hutao can still be used normally and will automatically download missing resources when loading images.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since its establishment on GitHub on April 18, 2022, the Snap Hutao project has received extensive support from the open-source community and users. As the project has developed, we have built a series of supporting services as middleware for Snap Hutao.</p>
<p>Currently, the development team is making some of these practical services available to the open-source community in the form of open interfaces, for use by developers who share our vision. We have written detailed usage documentation for these interfaces, provide maintenance support, and answer frequently asked questions. Whether you are an experienced developer or a beginner, we hope that these interfaces can assist you in your application development.</p>
<h2>Snap Hutao API &amp; Snap Hutao Cloud Developer License</h2>
<p>The Snap Hutao API is an interface service that exposes the Snap Hutao Spiral Abyss Database, designed to provide data access support for open-source software developers.</p>
<p>By applying for the Snap Hutao API Developer License, developers will not only gain access to the database but also receive full access to the Snap Hutao Cloud features within Snap Hutao as a bonus.</p>
<p>Developers can submit applications through the <a href="https://homa.snapgenshin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Snap Hutao API Open Platform</a> to obtain a developer license.</p>
<h2>UIGF Interchangeable Data Record</h2>
<p>The Snap Hutao project is committed to promoting the free flow of user data among different open-source tools, and to this end, it has drafted the initial version of the <a href="https://uigf.org/en/standards/UIGF.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uniformed Interchangeable Gacha Log Format (UIGF)</a>.</p>
<p>This standard has now been recognized and adopted by an increasing number of developers and is continuously being improved.</p>
<p>Many developers have gathered at the <a href="https://github.com/UIGF-org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UIGF-Org</a> open-source organization. We hope to use this platform to promote communication between developers and users, obtain more feedback and technical advancements, and further create excellent open-source Genshin Impact tools.</p>

<div class="hint-container important">
<p class="hint-container-title">Breaking Changes</p>
<p>Snap Hutao recently obtained sponsorship from the SignPath Foundation for code signing certificates. Starting from version 1.9.0, we will use a brand-new certificate to sign Snap Hutao installation packages.</p>
<p>Programs with the new signature will be incompatible with old versions. Users updating from versions 1.8.4 and older to 1.9.0 and newer versions need to uninstall the old version first and then perform a fresh installation of the new version of the client. Due to the design of Snap Hutao's data directory, users will not lose any important data.</p>
<p>You can read the article <a href="/en/blog/version-1-9-0-breaking-changes.html" target="_blank">Explanation of Breaking Changes in Version 1.9.0</a> for a deeper understanding of how the signature changes in this version update affect the Snap Hutao project.</p>

<p>Snap Hutao primarily focuses on supporting the Genshin Impact Chinese server. Currently, we are gradually improving support for oversea servers, encompassing language localization and feature internationalization.
Due to the different types of restrictions on both types of server, the implementation of some features may vary. For example, the wish history export for oversea servers does not support the more convenient SToken refresh method.</p>

<div class="hint-container info">
<p class="hint-container-title">Prerequisites</p>
<p>This feature requires you to log in to your MiYouShe / HoYoLAB account in Snap Hutao. See the <a href="/en/features/mhy-account-switch.html" target="_blank">MiHoYo Multi-Account Switching</a> document for login instructions.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/1797064093/O1CN01YUyKil1g6e0x3SpKX_!!1797064093.png_.webp" alt="live-data-tracking" loading="lazy"></p>
<h2>Adding Real-time Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Click the "Add Real-time Notes" button.</li>
<li>In the "Add Real-time Notes" pop-up window, find the game character UID you want to add and click the plus button to its right.</li>
<li>The added game character will be displayed on the "Real-time Notes" page.
<ul>
<li>Real-time Notes will automatically refresh data at fixed intervals.</li>
<li>Click "Notification Settings" in the upper-right corner of the window to set the refresh interval.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To get the latest data immediately, click the "Refresh Now" button.</li>
<li>If a <code>-1034</code> error occurs when refreshing data, it means that miHoYo's anti-bot risk control mechanism has been triggered. This can be resolved by configuring invisible verification in the Snap Hutao settings.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Verifying User and Character</h2>
<p>If you are using a MiYouShe account, the anti-bot mechanism may trigger a verification code, preventing Real-time Notes data from refreshing.
The following steps can solve this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the "Verify Current User and Character" button in the upper-left corner of the Real-time Notes page.</li>
<li>Snap Hutao will display a verification window. Complete the verification to refresh the data for the affected account.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Global Notification Settings</h2>
<p>Clicking "Notification Settings" in the upper-right corner of the window allows you to configure the global behavior of the Real-time Notes feature, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enable/Disable Automatic Data Refresh</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Set the Automatic Data Refresh Interval</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Do Not Disturb Mode</strong>:
<ul>
<li>When enabled, notifications will only appear in the system notification center.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>High Priority Notifications</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Prevents notifications from being automatically moved to the action center, but may interfere with daily use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Custom Data Forwarding Webhook</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Snap Hutao allows users to forward Real-time Notes data to third-party programs to reduce direct requests to the miHoYo API.</li>
<li>Enter the third-party program's <code>HTTP API</code> interface address in the "Real-time Notes Webhook URL" field. Snap Hutao will forward the raw data to this interface using a <code>POST</code> request.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Account-Specific Settings</h2>
<ol>
<li>Hover your mouse over the Real-time Notes window of the character whose settings you want to modify.</li>
<li>Click the settings button in the upper-right corner of the window to access the following settings options:
<ul>
<li><strong>Original Resin Reminder Threshold</strong> (range: 0–200)</li>
<li><strong>Realm Currency Reminder Threshold</strong> (range: 0–2400)</li>
<li><strong>Enable Parametric Transformer Reminder</strong> (on/off)</li>
<li><strong>Enable Daily Commission Cap Reminder</strong> (on/off)</li>
<li><strong>Enable Expedition Completion Reminder</strong> (on/off)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After modifying the settings, click the "Save" button to save the current settings.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Deleting a Character</h2>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Why does setting automatic refresh for Real-time Notes display "Failed to modify Scheduled Task"?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Automatic refresh of Real-time Notes relies on the Windows Task Scheduler.</li>
<li>To avoid permission issues, Snap Hutao sets task schedules in non-administrator mode.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If you have enabled automatic refresh in an older version, you can manually delete the old task schedule in Task Scheduler. The task schedule name is <code>SnapHutaoDailyNoteRefreshTask</code>.</li>
<li>If you have not enabled task schedules before, the current Windows user account may not have sufficient permissions. Try using an administrator account.</li>
<li>If the problem persists, you may need to reinstall the system.</li>
</ol>

<div class="hint-container tip">
<p class="hint-container-title">Tips</p>
<p>Snap Hutao supports accounts from the mainland China version of the MiHoYo forum, <strong>MiYouShe</strong>, and the international version, <strong>HoYoLAB</strong>. HoYoLAB blocks network connections from mainland China by default, and Snap Hutao cannot bypass this restriction on its own.</p>
<ul>
<li>The account switching described in this document refers to <strong>MiYouShe / HoYoLAB accounts</strong> used for obtaining game data, not <strong>in-game Genshin Impact accounts</strong>.</li>
<li>Before using this feature, you need to log in to your account using the official MiYouShe app to initialize your MiYouShe functions.
<ul>
<li>If the account name logged into Snap Hutao is in the format "user_123456789", it may not have been initialized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/1797064093/O1CN01ZhnkRl1g6e0tz18y9_!!1797064093.png.png_.webp" alt="Multi-Account Management Example" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>You can find the account menu in the lower-left corner of the main program interface, above the settings button, to manage the MiYouShe accounts you've logged into Snap Hutao. In the pop-up panel, you can add MiYouShe or HoYoLAB accounts. The login methods are similar:</p>

<ul>
<li>After completing this, you can switch between logged-in MiYouShe accounts in the account management panel.
<ul>
<li>After adding a new MiYouShe account, you need to manually click on the newly logged-in account in the account switching function in the lower-left corner of the main interface to set it as the active account.</li>
<li>You can copy the corresponding account's Cookie or remove the account from Snap Hutao in the account management menu.</li>
<li>When the program is not running in administrator mode, you can drag and drop to sort the accounts.</li>
<li>After selecting a logged-in account, you can:
<ul>
<li>Click the "Refresh Cookie" button to update the currently stored Cookie.</li>
<li>Click the "Check-In" button to perform the MiHoYo forum check-in. For MiYouShe accounts, you need to resolve the risk control status first to successfully perform the check-in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="hint-container info">
<p class="hint-container-title">Security Tips</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SToken</code> is a security-sensitive Cookie field, and you <strong>should not</strong> store Cookies containing the <code>SToken</code> field on any cloud or other devices where data security cannot be guaranteed.</li>
<li>The Cookie obtained from Snap Hutao contains this field. Please carefully consider whether to provide the <code>SToken</code> field to the receiving party.</li>
<li><strong>When you log in to MiYouShe via password or Cookie in Snap Hutao, your data is only processed by the MiYouShe server and the local Snap Hutao, and does not pass through any third-party services, including the Snap Hutao server.</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Common Issues</h2>
<h3>Why does the MiYouShe account login status often expire, and added accounts disappear?</h3>
<ul>
<li>We maintain the login status by storing the account's MiYouShe Cookie.</li>
<li>However, when a user <strong>logs out of the account</strong> in a browser or on another device, the Cookie maintaining the login status will <strong>expire</strong>.</li>
<li>This will cause the MiYouShe account in Snap Hutao to be automatically removed after startup.</li>
<li>This situation may also occur due to network connection issues preventing the validation of the Cookie. Therefore, please prioritize restarting Snap Hutao if this happens.</li>
<li>Since October 2022, MiYouShe has greatly increased the probability of an account being flagged as at risk. When an <a href="/en/advanced/exceptions.html#%E7%8A%B6%E6%80%811034-%E9%AA%8C%E8%AF%81%E5%A4%B1%E8%B4%A5" target="_blank">account is at risk</a>, the Cookie may also not be recognized as valid.</li>
<li>Since version 1.4.15, you can refresh the login status by refreshing the Cookie in the account panel.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The gacha system is one of the core gameplay elements in Genshin Impact. Whether for commemorative or show-off purposes, or for seriously planning your pulls, analyzing historical gacha data is crucial. However, Genshin Impact only provides one year of wish history, which isn't enough for long-term players (<s>though they do track how many of Timmie's pigeons you've eliminated in a year</s>).</p>
<p>Therefore, the Wish Export feature of Snap Hutao was created to help players transfer their wish data locally for permanent storage and long-term analysis.</p>
<p>For the technical principles of exporting Genshin Impact wish records, please refer to <a href="/en/advanced/Gacha-system-and-export-principal.html" target="_blank"><strong>Gacha System and Export Principles</strong></a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/1797064093/O1CN01otuXYg1g6e0wnNwX2_!!1797064093.png_.webp" alt="Wish Export" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>As shown above, Snap Hutao's Wish Export feature helps users clearly track and analyze their gacha data, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total number of wishes</li>
<li>Current pity count</li>
<li>Number and percentage of weapons and characters obtained by different rarities</li>
<li>Number of wishes per 5-star pull and pity status</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, <strong>Snap Hutao Cloud users can access gacha prediction data calculated by the cloud servers</strong>.</p>
<div class="hint-container note">
<p class="hint-container-title">Delay in Genshin Impact Wish Records</p>
<p>Snap Hutao's data source is the miHoYo server. Therefore, recently made wishes may not be immediately available.
When you see the latest records in the in-game wish history, the corresponding statistics can be obtained in Snap Hutao.</p>
</div>
<h2>Fetch Wish Data</h2>
<h3>SToken Refresh </h3>
<div class="hint-container info">

<li>If you have obtained the wish history URL from another tool, select "Manual URL Input" and follow the prompts.</li>
<li>Please note that the URL <strong>has a time limit</strong>, so complete the operation as soon as possible.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Full Refresh Mode</h3>
<ul>
<li>By default, Snap Hutao will stop importing after matching existing local records to avoid duplicates.</li>
<li>If you wish to fully retrieve all historical records from the Genshin Impact server, select "Full Refresh" before starting the refresh process.</li>
</ul>
<div class="hint-container tip">
<p class="hint-container-title">Tips</p>

<h2>Remote Debugging</h2>
<p>When developers cannot reproduce certain issues on their own devices, they may need to perform remote debugging to locate the problem. If you agree to participate in remote debugging, a designated administrator will add you as a friend via QQ/Discord and invite you to a remote assistance group for communication.</p>
<p><strong>The computer participating in remote debugging must meet the following conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At least 15GB of free hard drive space.</li>
<li>Sufficient network traffic to support the debugging operations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preparation Before Debugging</h3>
<ol>
<li>Perform steps <code>1~3</code> in <a href="/en/development/contribute.html" target="_blank">Contribute Code - Setting Up Snap Hutao Project</a>.</li>
<li>Download and install the <a href="https://uuyc.163.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netease UU</a> remote tool or <a href="https://parsec.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parsec</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remote debugging will help us solve problems more quickly. Thank you for your support!</p>
