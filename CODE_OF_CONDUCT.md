# Contributor Code of Conduct

At Snap Hutao, we are dedicated to building and maintaining a safe, welcoming, and inclusive community. To ensure a positive and respectful experience for everyone, we have established this Code of Conduct.

This code applies to all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, community channels (like Discord and QQ), and any other forums managed by the project.

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

*   **Using welcoming and inclusive language.**
*   **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.**
*   **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.**
*   **Focusing on what is best for the community.**
*   **Showing empathy towards other community members.**

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

*   **The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.**
*   **Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.**
*   **Public or private harassment.**
*   **Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.**
*   **Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.**

## Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting

If you are subject to or witness any violations of this Code of Conduct, please report it by contacting the project team at [support@dgp-studio.cn](mailto:support@dgp-studio.cn). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project team members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
