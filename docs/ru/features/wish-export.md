# Wish History

Gacha is one of the core gameplay in Genshin Impact. Whether it's for commemorative and show-off purposes,
or for serious planning for a gacha strategy, it's very important to perform statical analysis on historical gacha record.
However, Genshin Impact only provides players with six months of gacha records, which is not user-friendly ~~(although they
still keep tracking how many Timmie's pigeons you've killed for the whole year)~~

Therefore, we need to use the gacha records from these six months to retrieve the data and transfer the record to our
local device. This is the purpose of wish history export feature in Snap Hutao.

Regarding the technical principles of exporting Genshin Impact gacha records,
you can refer to our article on [Gacha System and Export Principles](../advanced/Gacha-system-and-export-principal.html)

**As shown in the above figure, through the wish history feature in Snap Hutao, you can clearly obtain the following information:
total number of wishes, current pity count, quantity and percentage of obtained items with different rarity, number of
times a 5-star rarity item was not obtained and the current pity status.**

**Additionally, user with Hutao Cloud can view prediction data calculated by Hutao Cloud server**

::: note Delay in Gacha Data Export

Snap Hutao retrieves gacha records from the MiHoYo servers, which means that recently made wishes may not be immediately
available. When you see the latest batch of gacha records in the game's own history, then you can then obtain the corresponding
statistics from Snap Hutao.

### Explanation on Full Refresh Option

By default, Snap Hutao will stop importing gacha records once it matches a Wish ID that already exists locally.
However, if you wish to obtain all the historical records from the Genshin Impact servers
(even if they are already present in your local wish history), you can check the "Full Refresh" option.

Not selecting `Full Refresh` will **not** cause you to lose your wishing data,
and selecting `Full Refresh` will **not** cause your local records to mistakenly record the same wishing data twice.
