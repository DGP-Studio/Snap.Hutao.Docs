  to assume any risk on your own.
- You need to enable advanced features in Snap Hutao's settings page

:::

### Unlock Frame Rate Limit

::: caution

- The [Unlocker project](https://github.com/DGP-Studio/Unlocker) only affects the UnityPlayer itself, directly affecting
  the Unity3D engine, and does not have a direct relationship with the game itself. Essentially, it is no different from
  settings like 120 FPS in mobile devices. However, you should still use it with caution and read the [user agreement](../statements/tos.md)
  on your own.

:::

- Run Snap Hutao as administrator
- Enter Game Launcher page
- At the bottom of the page, you can find `Unlock Frame Rate Limit` option

  - Trigger the switch to enable or disable this feature
  - In the `Set Frame Rate Limit` field, you can adjust the limit freely

- Fact that may cause **failure in unlocking frame rate limit**:
  - Snap Hutao process is not kept in the background
  - `V-Sync` is not set to off in the game
  - `Max Framerate` limit is not changed in your graphic card settings
  - `Power Saving` mode is not disabled in power settings
  - Your graphic card is not powerful enough
