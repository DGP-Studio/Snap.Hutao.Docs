You can choose a project of interest from the Snap Hutao 2025 Development Roadmap and be responsible for its implementation. You can post replies in the relevant issues or seek collaboration to solve problems encountered in development through the developer community group.

If you have unique ideas and can develop a prototype, we also welcome development based on non-C# .NET technologies. You can contact us through the developer community group. For example, the current Snap Hutao's [Generic Backend Service](https://github.com/DGP-Studio/Generic-API) is developed based on Python FastAPI.
