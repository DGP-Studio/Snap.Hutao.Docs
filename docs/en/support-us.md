# Support Us

Snap Hutao, as an open-source project licensed under the MIT License, is dedicated to creating a completely free, ad-free, and privacy-focused program. Our development team members are currently self-funding the project's operation and, through modern technology, have minimized operating costs as much as possible. The current major expenses are for the network system components required for server operation (you can find our summarized annual expenditures at the bottom of this page). If you have surplus funds to support Snap Hutao, your generous donation will not only assist the development team but will also benefit every Snap Hutao user. Currently, you can donate to us through the following channels:
