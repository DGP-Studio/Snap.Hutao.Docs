## Engage our Localization

- Snap Hutao
  - We created an issue thread named `[Hoyolab] on GitHub: Globalization support` [Issue](https://github.com/DGP-Studio/Snap.Hutao/issues/144)
    - We will update our process in this thread
    - You can declare your localization engagement in the thread, and we will provide the necessary support
      - We also welcome PR directly
  - **You can provide your translation at [translate.hut.ao](https://translate.hut.ao)**
- Snap Hutao Docs
  - The developer team is maintaining Chinese documents and working on English documents
    - We thank [QweRezOn](https://github.com/QweRezOn) for the documentation in Russian
  - You can clone the [docs repository](https://github.com/DGP-Studio/Snap.Hutao.Docs), translate docs with your
    favorite tools, and make a Pull Request to contribute your work to the main repository
  - If you are adding a new language, you can copy the entire `en` folder and rename it with [ISO 639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
    - For example `jp` as Japanese
    - Do not translate based on Chinese docs (`zh`) as there are some content only specific useful for Chinese users; they are not useful for international users.
