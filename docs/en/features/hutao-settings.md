## Administrator Mode Tools

On the right side of the settings page, the development team has set up an administrator mode tool for users who need it. Under this module, we provide two functions:

1. Restart the program immediately as an administrator
2. Create a PowerShell shortcut on the desktop to start Hutao as administrator

## CAPTCHA

> This feature is most likely to be useful for CN server (MiYouShe) users

If daily check-in and realtime notes functions are essential for you, then the `-1034` error from miHoYo's anti-bot verification will definitely be a major interference. This is because miHoYo uses Geetest to intercept requests directly executed by non-humans, and some requests from Snap Hutao will be judged by Geetest as robot behavior and cause request failure. If you use a third-party service to verify the Geetest captcha, you can pass the random data generated by Geetest to the verification service provider through this setting.

After successfully configuring this setting, Snap Hutao will directly call this verification service to pass the Geetest verification when performing real-time note automatic refresh and miHoYo community check-in, avoiding the generation of -1034 error by miHoYo.
