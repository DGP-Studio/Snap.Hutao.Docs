# Initialization Guide

When launching Snap Hutao for the first time, the program will automatically enter the initialization guide to help users correctly configure the various functions of the tool.
The guide process includes setting the language, confirming important user agreements, checking the necessary system environment, and downloading static resources.

## Language Settings

In the language settings section, you can choose the interface language supported by Snap Hutao. If you change the language, the program will automatically restart to apply the changes.

- Simplified Chinese is the base language of Snap Hutao, and the development team also maintains the English translation.
- Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean translations are contributed by the Crowdin community.
- The remaining languages are translated by the Google Gemini AI model.

In the user agreement section, you need to read and agree to the relevant agreements and terms of service provided by Snap Hutao. These documents are designed to help you understand the nature of the Snap Hutao project and the rules for using the tool.

Snap Hutao will automatically detect the following key runtime environments and prompt the user whether they need to be installed or updated:

1. **Segoe Fluent Icons font**: Provides a better interface icon display effect.  
   Download address: [Segoe Fluent Icons](https://aka.ms/SegoeFluentIcons)
2. **WebView2 Runtime**: A modern browser component that supports the core functions of the tool.  
   Download address: [WebView2 Runtime](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2124701)

If a missing environment is detected, you can click the corresponding link to download and complete the installation.  
The above image shows the expected display effect of this step under a complete environment.

In the resource download section, Snap Hutao will automatically obtain the required static image resources. After the resource download is complete, the initialization process will automatically close, and the main interface of the tool will be loaded.

If the resource download fails, Snap Hutao can still be used normally and will automatically download missing resources when loading images.
