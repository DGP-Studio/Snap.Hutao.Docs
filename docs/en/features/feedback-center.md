The Feedback Center is a feature page provided by the Snap Hutao development team to help users solve common problems. This page is laid out in a left-right structure.

On the left side of the page, we provide a convenient entry point for searching Snap Hutao documents. You can get relevant page search results by entering keywords in the search box.

On the right side of the page, we provide several useful features.

- The first part displays key information about Snap Hutao, including the version of Snap Hutao, device ID, device network information, and Webview 2 runtime version information.
- The second part includes links to Snap Hutao project issues, roadmap, and service availability monitoring.
- The third part includes documents of the main functions of Snap Hutao. You can click on the corresponding function to jump to the corresponding document page.
