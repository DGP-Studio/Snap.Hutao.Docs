# Common Program Exceptions

This document covers solutions of **foreseeable client error**

## Return Code: -10001

- This error comes directly from MiHoYo BBS, hints include
  - `Return Code: -10001`
  - `Return Code: -100`
- Issue source
  1. Cookie expired
  2. Network error
  3. System time is not accurate
- Solution
  1. In the account panel, execute `Refresh Cookies`
  2. Remove your account and add it again
  3. Sync your system time

## Return Code: 1034 Verification Failed

- If Snap Hutao returns `1034` status code and hints verification failed (usually during the operation of Realtime Notes),
  it means the operation is blocked by MiHoYo BBS anti-bot system
- Solution:
  - Enter `Realtime Notes`
  - Click on `Verify Current User and Role` button
  - Follow the instruction in MiHoYo BBS to verify
  - After finishing the verification process, click `Complete` to close the verification window
  - Now, the account should back to normal; If not, process the step above again
    ::: tip

If the risk prompt is too frequent, or the verification cannot be triggered at all, it means that the risk of your
account is too high, please change the password, so that the simultaneous login status of multiple devices will be reset

:::

::: warning

- You hardly cannot pass imperceptible verification when your account is **login at other remote Genshin tools** or
  **login at multiple devices**. This is a security designing of MiHoYo BBS, and cannot bypass
- If you are using **multiple MiHoYo BBS account in your device**, **frequent usage with MiHoYo BBS API** will
  result in your IP address being banned for a period of time (usually no more than 24 hours). This is a security
  designing of MiHoYo BBS, and cannot bypass
