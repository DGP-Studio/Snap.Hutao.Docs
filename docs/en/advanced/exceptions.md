If the risk prompt is too frequent, or the verification cannot be triggered at all, it means that the risk of your
account is too high, please change the password, so that the simultaneous login status of multiple devices will be reset

- You hardly cannot pass imperceptible verification when your account is **login at other remote Genshin tools** or
  **login at multiple devices**. This is a security designing of MiHoYo BBS, and cannot bypass

## Error Downloading PIC Resources

The failure to download a small portion of static image resources will not significantly degrade the experience of Snap Hutao. The client will automatically re-download any missing image resources as needed.

### `Received an unexpected EOF or 0 bytes from the transport stream.` / Response stream does not contain valid content type

This issue may be triggered by many factors such as hitting download limits or network fluctuations. You can close the client and wait for a moment, then, try downloading again, or attempt to switch your network connection.

## Error Finding Required Modules

When user launching game with unlock frame-rate feature on, the game may be failed to be launched with the following error shows up:

1. Error finding required modules: could not read any module, the protection driver may have been loaded
2. Error finding required modules: timeout

This issue only occurs when Genshin Impact's anti-cheat module starts earlier than frame-rate-unlocker module.
When these errors happen, Snap Hutao will exit game process, and you can re-launch the game.

## Application installation failed. Error message: An internal error occurred 0x80073D05

The primary reason for encountering the error code `0x80073D05` during installation is that some local files were not deleted during a previous uninstallation.

- You need to open `%appdata%/../Local/Packages`.
- Locate and delete the folder named `60568DGPStudio.SnapHutao_wbnnev551gwxy` (if you are facing privilege issues, consider using `NSudo_LG` to resolve the issue. For detailed usage, please search on Google).

## Error 0x8007007E or "The specified file/module cannot be found"

This issue is caused by missing MSVC runtime libraries. Please install the latest version of the **MSVC Runtime Library**.
