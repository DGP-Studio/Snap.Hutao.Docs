If you are in a poor network, you may slow or even stuck at framework installation stage. In such a scenario, you can
download the framework from Microsoft website and install it manually.

1. Visit Microsoft document page：[Latest downloads for the Windows App SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/downloads)
2. Click on `Dwonload the latest x64 stable installer` to download the offline installer
3. Run Windows App Runtime installer you just downloaded, and then install Snap Hutao
