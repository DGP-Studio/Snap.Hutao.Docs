All functions provided by all projects are "open-source" and "non-business" in nature. If you are dissatisfied with the security of any projects developed by the team, please uninstall/delete/stop using them immediately. If you continue to use them normally, it means that you approve of the security of any projects developed by the team.

Any "unexpected losses (including but not limited to: software, hardware, property, virtual items, etc.)", "contractual damage", "defamation", "copyright or intellectual property infringement," and the resulting losses and liabilities caused by the use of any content in any projects developed by the team are all "losses and liabilities" caused by the user's own use behavior of open-source software on the Internet. Based on the MIT license declared in all works at their open-source location (i.e., GitHub) and the content stipulated in this declaration, it should be deemed that the aforementioned "losses and liabilities" have no responsibility relationship with all the relevant developers of the projects.
