# Abuse Report

Snap Hutao is committed to providing Genshin Impact desktop players with a more convenient and enhanced non-destructive experience.  
All of our features are implemented without altering or interfering with the game’s server data, ensuring that they do not affect other players’ normal gameplay in any way.

However, we **strongly oppose** and will take serious action against the following behaviors:  
Any reverse engineering, repackaging, or injection of third-party modules that **use the Snap Hutao client for destructive, competitive, or cheating purposes**.

## Definition of Abuse and Cheating

The following actions are considered violations of Snap Hutao’s usage policy and constitute abuse, including but not limited to:

- **Modifying the Snap Hutao client** to assist or load destructive or intrusive cheating modules;
- Using Snap Hutao’s injection feature or any of its derivatives to gain unfair advantages in **any form of competitive, PvP, or confrontational community activity**;
- Modifying in-game parameters related to combat, logic, or visuals (such as “field of view” or “elemental burst camera”) and then participating in the above competitive activities;
- Using the Snap Hutao injection feature for purposes inconsistent with the project’s intent, including but not limited to disrupting other players’ experiences, falsifying client data, or creating deceptive gameplay demonstrations.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The “injection” feature of Snap Hutao is a technical mechanism that interacts with the game through in-memory modification.  
> We only provide this feature for **single-player, non-competitive** use to improve the player experience. It is **not** an “exploit” or “cheat tool” in the conventional sense.  
> Any use of this feature in **multiplayer or competitive contexts** will be deemed abuse and bears **no association with the official stance of Snap Hutao**.

## Reporting Procedure

If you discover any of the above behaviors in public communities, forums, or video platforms, you may report them through the following steps:

1. Join the [Snap Hutao Community](../community.md);
2. Contact any non-bot administrator;
3. Provide clear evidence (such as screenshots, video links, or relevant records).

If sufficient evidence is provided, we will impose a **feature ban** on the offending game UID.  
Banned accounts will be unable to use the injection feature in the Snap Hutao Advanced Launcher.

**DGP-Studio reserves the final right of interpretation and enforcement** regarding violations of these policies.

We encourage every player to help maintain a fair, healthy, and creative Genshin Impact community.

We do not endorse or support any unofficial competitive or PvP activities within Genshin Impact.
