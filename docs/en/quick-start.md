# Quick Start

Follow this quick start guide to quickly set up Snap Hutao.

## <HopeIcon icon="iconfont icon-windows" size="1.7rem" color="rgb(0, 168, 232)" /> Minimum System Requirements

| Requirement                | Specification                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Minimum OS Version**     | Windows 10 Build 19045 (22H2)<br/> Windows 11 Build 22621 (22H2) |
| **Recommended OS Version** | Windows 11 Build 22621 (22H2) or later versions                  |
| **Required Components**    | Windows Update, App Installer                                    |
| Optional Components        | WebView2 Runtime, **MSVC Runtime Library**                       |

**Unsupported OS Versions**:

1.  **LTSC and LTSB versions** are not supported due to not including a sufficiently new version of MSIX Core, and require manual handling to install.
2.  **Enterprise and modified versions of Windows are not supported. Issues from any non-Microsoft official full version of system will not be actively addressed.**
3.  Windows 10 Build 19041 can also be installed, but some functions may not be available due to kernel issues. Therefore, issues with Snap Hutao under this version will not be addressed.
4.  Issues with Windows Insider preview versions will not be addressed.

### <HopeIcon icon="iconfont icon-refresh" size="1.5rem" color="rgb(127, 186, 0)" /> Upgrade from Microsoft Store Version to the Latest Version

> You can read [Explanation of Breaking Changes in Version 1.9.0](blog/version-1-9-0-breaking-changes.md) for more details.

If you have installed the Microsoft Store version of Snap Hutao (version number between 1.4.11 and 1.8.5), you need to uninstall the old version before performing a new installation.

- Uninstall the old application according to the [Uninstall Snap Hutao](advanced/uninstall.html) provided in the documentation.
  - Data will not be affected as long as the data directory is not manually deleted.
- Install the new version of the application according to the method described above.

### <HopeIcon icon="iconfont icon-update" size="1.5rem" color="rgb(255, 185, 0)" /> Update Snap Hutao

Unless otherwise stated, you can update by running [Snap.Hutao.Deployment](https://api.snapgenshin.com/patch/hutao-deployment/download) or installing the latest MSIX installation package.

Since version 1.9.0, Snap Hutao has a built-in upgrade notification function to remind you to get the update package. If the update fails, you can try using [Snap.Hutao.Deployment](https://api.snapgenshin.com/patch/hutao-deployment/download) to overwrite the installation to solve the problem.

- Data will not be affected as long as the data directory is not manually deleted.

## <HopeIcon icon="iconfont icon-expansion" size="1.7rem" color="rgb(7, 163, 161)" /> Install Optional Components

Through optional components, Snap Hutao can implement some functions more efficiently. Although they are not mandatory components, they can significantly improve the user experience.

### <img src="/images/202312/MSEdge.webp" alt="Edge" width="20" height="20"> WebView2 Runtime

The WebView2 Runtime is provided by Microsoft and allows Snap Hutao to embed low-overhead browser components. This component is used to implement the MiYouShe account WebView2 login function.

You can find the `Evergreen Standalone Installer` at the bottom of the [Microsoft official website](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/). Select `x64` to download and install.

### <img src="/images/202409/Microsoft-logo.svg" alt="Microsoft" width="20" height="20"> Segoe Fluent Icons Font

This font is provided by Microsoft and optimizes the icon display effect of Snap Hutao. Missing this font may cause some icons to not display correctly.

Click [this link](https://aka.ms/SegoeFluentIcons) to download the font ZIP file. After unzipping, right-click to install the font to the system.

### <img src="/images/202409/Microsoft-logo.svg" alt="Microsoft" width="20" height="20"> MSVC Runtime Library (MSVCRT)

The MSVC Runtime Library is a necessary component to unlock the frame rate function. If you are prompted with "Missing XXX.dll" or "Missing XXX component", please install the latest version of MSVCRT.

Click [this link](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) to download the MSVC Runtime Library (x64) installation file and complete the installation.
